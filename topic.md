# choose your topic 

- needs to fit EPSRC remit 


## It should be something:

- that you are genuinely interested in,
- that is realistic,
- that is achievable,
- that you know enough about,
- that has genuine impact.


## EPSRC remit 

- have a positive societal or economic impact
- cutting edge world leading physics
- enable the UKâ€™s national capability to be used to best advantage
- collaborations between researchers in disciplines beyond physics


### Past projects -> number of grants
#### past projects that are physics related (most to least)

- condensed matter (magnets) -> 87 
- bio/soft matter physics -> 85 
- materials for energy -> 76 
- photonics -> 76 
- condensed matter (electronic) -> 73 
- spin-tronics -> 54 
- Quantum Optics and Information -> 46
- light matter interactions -> 42 
- superconductivity -> 35 


### ideas / what good will come from it

- wide band gap semiconductors 
  - gallium oxide 
    - needs work on reducing defects
    - helps increase efficiency 
  - for high voltage electronics 
    - make electric cars better
  - particle detectors
    - save life's 
  - purify water
    - help save life's again




## case for picking topic 


### what?

- state exactly what you want to do (catch readers attention)
- know your audience

1. gallium oxide 
2. wide band gap semi conductors
  

### why?

- state exactly why you want to do it 
- business / career / exciting field / etc etc ...


### how?

- know your stuff (as much as possible at this stage in your career)
- if you don't know how to do the project there is no project 
- impact is important (what will it be good for)


### who?

- clearly state your or the team's expertise
- if not in the area of research -> subcontract 
- who is required to do the research (don't forget collaborations)


### when?

- have a realistic time scale 
- make a chart
- aim to be first


### how much?

- need a detailed understanding of all the costs required to complete the project 
  - staff 
  - capital items 
  - consumables
  - facilities
  - travel costs 
  - overheads


match the funding with the effort

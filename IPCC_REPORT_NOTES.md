# Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability

RPC 2.6 = 0.9->2.3C
RPC 4.5 = 1.7->3.2C
RPC 6 = 2.0->3.7C
RPC 8.5 = 3.2->5.4C

green water = rain fall 
blue water = irrigation


## Chapter 4.4.7 (projected changes in water quality)

- Water quality degradation is a threat due to "legacy contaminant's in
  glaciers and permafrost"
- "Drought-driven diminishing river and  lake levels and continued water
  abstraction for irrigation may contribute to the salinisation of soil and
  water"


## Chapter 4.5.1 (projected risk to agriculture)

- Overall irrigation water demand to increase by 2080 meaning there's a high
  confidence that 
  - there will be vulnerability for rain-fed agriculture. 
  - there will be yield reduction specifically in wheat and rice fields.

- Projected crop yield losses up to 32% by 2100 (RPC8.5) or 12% by 2100(RPC4.5)
- (RPC 8.5) "Overall drought-driven yield loss is estimated to increase by
  9-11%(wheat), 5.6-6.3%(maize), 18.1-19.4%(rice) and 15.1-16.1%(soybean)"
- (RPC6.0) "Over 50% of the global lowlands used for irrigation will depend
  heavily on mountain runoff and are projected to make use of unsustainable use
  of blue water"
- "Globally 10%(+_5%) of pasture areas are projected to be vulnerable to water
  scarcity"


## 4.5.3 (projected risk to water, sanitation and hygiene)

- "studies show that degraded water quality increases the willingness to pay
  for clean water regardless of socioeconomic status"
- "sewage overflows resulting from heavy rainfall events are expected to
  increase waterborne disease outbreaks"
- "high diarrhoeal disease burdens mean that small changes in climate
  associated risk are projected to have significant impacts on disease burdens"
- for 2.1 degrees C change it's projected that there are going to be 2.2
  million more cases in Bangladesh by 2100
- projected that by 2030 children under 15 globally will have an extra 48,000
  deaths from diarrhoea 


## 4.5.6 (projected risk to water related conflicts)

- 13% probability increase at 2 degrees C that intra-state conflicts occur,
  especially risky in places close to the equator that will face the majority
  of the droughts and that have fragile political climates

## Chapter 4.4.1 (projected changes in precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture)

### multi-model median change

- There are projected changes of precipitation on the Indian sub-continent at a
  temperature mean of 1.5C, ranging from 10-20% decrease to a 40-50% increase.
- At 1.5C there is a predicted increase change of precipitation from 20-30% in
  the eastern Sahel, south-central Asia and parts of Greenland and Antarctica.
- There's a strong consensus of decrease of precipitation at 1.5C in south
  America, southern Africa and the Mediterranean.

### 5th and 95th percentile

- Although the median precipitation changes aren't that drastic in absolute
  terms the 5th and 95th percentile predictions do show larger percentage
  changes that could be impactful.


## Chapter 4.4.5 (projected changes in droughts)

- "AR6 WGI/WG1 concluded that the total land area subject to increasing drought
  frequency and severity would expand, and in the Mediterranean, southwestern
  South America and western North America, future aridification will far exceed
  the magnitude of changes seen in the last millennium (high confidence)."
- "Many studies focus on precipitation-based drought indices, but higher
  evaporative demands and changes in snow cover are additional drivers of
  hydrological, agricultural and ecological drought in many regions."
- "At 1.5C the likelihood of extreme agriculture agriculture (soil moisture)
  drought is projected to at least double (100% increase) over large areas of
  northern South America, the Mediterranean, western China and high latitudes
  in North America and Eurasia. The likelihood is projected to increase by
  150-200% at 2C."

## Chapter 4.4.7 (projected changes in water quality)

- Water quality degradation is a threat due to "legacy contaminant's in
  glaciers and permafrost"
- "Drought-driven diminishing river and  lake levels and continued water
  abstraction for irrigation may contribute to the salinisation of soil and
  water"


## Chapter 4.5.1 (projected risk to agriculture)

- Overall irrigation water demand to increase by 2080 meaning there's a high
  confidence that 
  - there will be vulnerability for rain-fed agriculture. 
  - there will be yield reduction specifically in wheat and rice fields.

- Projected crop yield losses up to 32% by 2100 (RPC8.5) or 12% by 2100(RPC4.5)
- (RPC 8.5) "Overall drought-driven yield loss is estimated to increase by
  9-11%(wheat), 5.6-6.3%(maize), 18.1-19.4%(rice) and 15.1-16.1%(soybean)"
- (RPC6.0) "Over 50% of the global lowlands used for irrigation will depend
  heavily on mountain runoff and are projected to make use of unsustainable use
  of blue water"
- "Globally 10%(+_5%) of pasture areas are projected to be vulnerable to water
  scarcity"


## 4.5.3 (projected risk to water, sanitation and hygiene)

- "studies show that degraded water quality increases the willingness to pay
  for clean water regardless of socioeconomic status"
- "sewage overflows resulting from heavy rainfall events are expected to
  increase waterborne disease outbreaks"
- "high diarrhoeal disease burdens mean that small changes in climate
  associated risk are projected to have significant impacts on disease burdens"
- for 2.1 degrees C change it's projected that there are going to be 2.2
  million more cases in Bangladesh by 2100
- projected that by 2030 children under 15 globally will have an extra 48,000
  deaths from diarrhoea 


## 4.5.6 (projected risk to water related conflicts)

- 13% probability increase at 2 degrees C that intra-state conflicts occur,
  especially risky in places close to the equator that will face the majority
  of the droughts and that have fragile political climates


## 4.8.1 (appropriate technologies)

- "In addition, innovations to reuse water through various wastewater recovery
  technologies (Diaz-Elsayed et al., 2019; Capodaglio, 2020), create potable
  water through desalinisation (Caldera et al., 2018) and reuse of wastewater
  in agriculture (Salgot and Folch, 2018) are also on the rise (Box 4.5)."
- "Solar technologies are increasingly used for irrigation, wastewater
  recovery, desalinisation and water harvesting (Algarni et al., 2018;
  Pouyfaucon and García-Rodríguez, 2018; Tu et al., 2018; Zhao F. et al.,
  2020)."
- Most of this development is happening in high income countries that most
  likely wont bear the costs of climate change making this a reason for drastic
  improvement of current technologies.
